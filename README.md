# Competitive-Programming-Python-Template

This repository serves competitive programmers who code in Python language. Being a Python coder, I have rarely seen fellow programmers use a proper template file while writing their code due to which it often takes time to implement certain functions and import required libraries. 

To increase efficiency while coding in Python, I have created a basic template.py file which contains necessary tools and libraries that are frequently used in coding contests. Using this template can reduce a lot of unnecessary typing in areas involving input/output format, using mathematical functions, python dictionaries, and other handy libraries.

I hope you find it useful!

PS: I'll keep updating this template with better code and additional tools as and when I feel the need.
